These are forming a part of the vast universe in which we are living. The glorious night sky is having dotted appearance with such objects. When anyone observes them using the telescope, these are looking very fascinating. As these are so far away, we cannot see all of them using our naked eye. Thus we need the telescopes to study them Our universe is containing an amazing collection of celestial objects or astronomical objects. Though most of the observable cosmos is composed of the empty space. Still, this cold, dark void which is sparsely populated by the number of astronomical objects. These are ranging from the common to the bizarre. These are the stuff which is filled with the empty space of the universe. We all are familiar with the stars, planets, and moons. But besides these, many celestial objects, are lying with an amazing collection of other sights.These are colourful nebulae, delicate star clusters as well as the massive galaxies.Pulsars and quasars are further adding to this mystery. Also, the black holes swallow up every bit of the matter which comes too close. This search is on to identify the mysterious, invisible objects termed as dark matter.",

            "description": "Stars are giant balls of hot gases that can produce their own light. Stars give out energy by converting Hydrogen gas into Helium in their cores. 
            Stars are gigantic in size and have an immense gravitational attraction. 
            The sun is a medium-sized star that gives us energy and makes life possible on earth.
            Calculating stellar distances.
            Distances to stars were first determined by the technique of trigonometric parallax, a method still used for nearby stars. 
            When the position of a nearby star is measured from two points on opposite sides of Earth’s orbit (i.e., six months apart), a small angular (artificial) displacement 
            is observed relative to a background of very remote (essentially fixed) stars. Using the radius of Earth’s orbit as the baseline, 
            the distance of the star can be found from the parallactic angle, p. If p = 1″ (one second of arc), the distance of the star is 206,265 times 
            Earth’s distance from the Sun—namely, 3.26 light-years. This unit of distance is termed the parsec, defined as the distance of an object whose 
            parallax equals one arc second. Therefore, one parsec equals 3.26 light-years. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, a star 
            at 10 parsecs would have a parallax of 0.1″. The nearest star to Earth, Proxima Centauri (a member of the triple system of Alpha Centauri), has a parallax of 0.76813″, 
            meaning that its distance is 1/0.76813, or 1.302, parsecs, which equals 4.24 light-years. The parallax of Barnard’s star, the next closest after the Alpha Centauri system, is 0.54831″, so that its distance is nearly 6 light-years.
             Errors of such parallaxes are now typically 0.001′′. Thus, measurements of trigonometric parallaxes are useful for only the nearby stars within a few thousand light-years. In fact, of the approximately 100 billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy (also simply called the Galaxy), 
             the Hipparcos satellite has measured only about 100,000 to an accuracy of 0.001′′. For more distant stars, indirect methods are used; most of them depend on comparing the intrinsic brightness of a star (found, for example, from its spectrum or other observable property) with its apparent brightness.
             Only three stars, Alpha Centauri, Procyon, and Sirius, are both among the 20 nearest and among the 20 brightest stars. Ironically, most of the relatively nearby stars are dimmer than the Sun and are invisible without the aid of a telescope. By contrast, some of the well-known bright stars outlining the constellations have parallaxes as small as the limiting value of 0.001″ and are therefore well beyond several hundred light-years’ distance from the Sun. The most luminous stars can be seen at great distances, whereas the intrinsically faint stars can be observed only if they are relatively close to Earth.
Although the lists of the brightest and the nearest stars pertain to only a very small number of stars, they nonetheless serve to illustrate some important points. The stars listed fall roughly into three categories: (1) giant stars and supergiant stars having sizes of tens or even hundreds of solar radii and extremely low average densities—in fact, several orders of magnitude less than that of water (one gram per cubic centimetre); (2) dwarf stars having sizes ranging from 0.1 to 5 solar radii and masses from 0.1 to about 10 solar masses; and (3) white dwarf stars having masses comparable to that of the Sun but dimensions appropriate to planets, meaning that their average densities are hundreds of thousands of times greater than that of water.
These rough groupings of stars correspond to stages in their life histories (see below Later stages of evolution). The second category is identified with what is called the main sequence (see below Hertzsprung-Russell diagram) and includes stars that emit energy mainly by converting hydrogen into helium in their cores. The first category comprises stars that have exhausted the hydrogen in their cores and are burning hydrogen within a shell surrounding the core. The white dwarfs represent the final stage in the life of a typical star, when most available sources of energy have been exhausted and the star has become relatively dim.
The large number of binary stars and even multiple systems is notable. These star systems exhibit scales comparable in size to that of the solar system. Some, and perhaps many, of the nearby single stars have invisible (or very dim) companions detectable by their gravitational effects on the primary star; this orbital motion of the unseen member causes the visible star to “wobble” in its motion through space. Some of the invisible companions have been found to have masses on the order of 0.001 solar mass or less, which is in the range of planetary rather than stellar dimensions. Current observations suggest that they are genuine planets, though some are merely extremely dim stars (sometimes called brown dwarfs). Nonetheless, a reasonable inference that can be drawn from these data is that double stars and planetary systems are formed by similar evolutionary processes.

A star is a form of a celestial object made up of a shining spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to the Earth is the Sun. Several other stars are visible to the naked eye from the Earth during the night time, looking at a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their enormous distance from the Earth. Historically, the most noticeable stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper tags. Astronomers have drawn together star catalogues that identify the known stars and deliver standardised stellar designations. However, it is estimated that there are over 300 sextillions (3×1023) stars in the Universe, including all-stars outside our galaxy (the Milky Way), which are invisible to the naked eye from the Earth.

A star's life starts with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of material composed mostly of hydrogen, along with helium and small amounts of heavier elements. When the lunar core is sufficiently thick, hydrogen becomes gradually converted into helium through nuclear fusion, liberating energy in the process. The rest of the interior of the star transfers energy away from the core through a mixture of the radiative and convective heat transfer process. The interior pressure prevents it from collapsing further under its own gravity. A star with a mass bigger than 0.4 times the Sun's mass will expand to become a red hulk when the hydrogen fuel in its core is exhausted.

            "description":"Our solar system can be divided into three regions: the inner solar system, the outer solar system, and the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud.

            The inner, rocky planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These worlds also are known as terrestrial planets because they have solid surfaces. Mercury, Earth, and Mars are currently being explored by spacecraft. Two rovers are on the surface of Mars. NASA's newest rover — Perseverance — landed on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021. Three missions are in development to return to Venus.
            
            The outer planets are gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and ice giants Uranus and Neptune. NASA's Juno spacecraft is on an extended mission at Jupiter and ESA's JUICE mission is on the way. NASA also is building Europa Clipper and Dragonfly to explore moons of Jupiter and Saturn.
            
            Beyond Neptune, a newer class of smaller worlds called dwarf planets reign, including longtime favorite Pluto. NASA's New Horizons spacecraft visited there in 2015, and is currently exploring the Kuiper Belt beyond Pluto. Thousands more planets have been discovered beyond our solar system. Scientists call them exoplanets (exo means "from outside").
            The word planet is derived from the word “planets” which means wanderer this name is given to them as they appear to wander in the night sky from east to west while stars also move from east to west but they seem to remain fixed relative to each other and the planet relative to them seem to move forward and backward. 
 
A planet is a celestial body that revolves around the sun in fixed orbits and planets do not have the light of their own but reflects the light of the sun they also do not twinkle like other stars as they are too close to us and till now the earth is the only known planet to harbor life and have the favorable condition.
 
Understanding the Planets
According to the widely accepted Big Bang theory, our Universe started with an explosion of a concentrated mass in space. Later the constellation of stars and planet systems emerged.
 
Our solar system is one of such many planetary systems. It consists of 8 planets in the order of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Pluto was discarded from the list in August 2006 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is now recognized as a dwarf planet.
 
The Sun present at the center of the Solar system is the hinge point and source of energy for all planets.  The first four inner planets are termed terrestrial planets as they are constructed of solid mass and have hard surfaces. They are also known as telluric planets or Rocky planets. The four exterior planets are giant balls of gases and are termed Jovian planets. 
 
Mankind has had knowledge about planets since ancient ages but after the invention of telescopes, scientists discovered the presence of the lesser-known Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.
 
Earth is the most distinct planet of all because of the life system it sustains. Being located at a very appropriate distance from the sun which maintains a convenient environment that is neither too hot nor too cold makes it possible.
 
Notes on Planets
Mercury 
It’s the nearest planet to the sun and is also the smallest planet in the solar system and takes around 88 days to complete one revolution (to be exact 88.97 days) which is the smallest time duration.
 
Its size is slightly larger than the size of the moon of earth. It does not have many moons and climatic conditions that are not favorable for any form of life as it is too near to the Sun. Its surface temperature ranges from 100 K at night to 700 K during the day (this high diurnal range of temperature is there because the planet has no atmosphere to retain and this is the highest among all planets).
 
It’s the second densest planet in our solar system with the smallest tilt in its axis among all the planets in the solar system.
 
Venus
When observed from the Earth, it’s the second brightest (after the observed moon) and takes 224.7 Earth days to complete one revolution and 243 Earth days for rotation on its axis (it takes the maximum time period among all planets to complete one rotation). It rotates in the opposite direction to all planets except Uranus (from West to East).
 
It’s also observed that one day on Venus is equal to one year on Earth. It’s also called Earth’s twin sister because of its similar size, shape, mass, and proximity to the sun and of its bulky composition. It’s not suitable for human settlement because it contains 96% carbon in the atmosphere. The surface temperature is very high (a mean temperature of 735K), making it the warmest planet in our solar system.
 
Earth
It’s the third planet from the Sun and is the only known planet to harbour life. The Earth's age is around 4.5 billion years old. It takes 365.264 days to complete one revolution around the Sun and 24 hours to complete one rotation on its axis (and after every four complete revolutions 4years4����� it takes a day longer 366 days to complete a revolution). It is covered by 71% of water and its crust is divided into different tectonic plates (lithosphere). Earth’s innermost part remains active and its inner core is solid while the outer core is liquid which generates Earth's magnetic field. 
Mars
It’s the fourth planet from the sun and also the second-smallest in the solar system. Its red colour also makes it known as the red planet (presence of iron oxide). It has two moons - Phobos and Deimos. Its gravity is 38% of the Earth's gravity and takes 687 Earth's day and one full Mars year (16,500 hours). 
Jupiter
It’s the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet among all. It’s also one of the brightest things that can be seen in the sky with the naked eye.
 
Jupiter is a giant ball of gases with a one-thousand mass of the Sun and lacks a well-defined surface.   
Saturn
It’s the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in the solar system. It’s a giant gas planet with an average radius that is nine times the radius of the earth. The inner core is made of iron and nickel. An electric current within the hydrogen layer gives rise to the magnetic field of Saturn which is a little less than the earth's magnetic field.  
Uranus
It’s the seventh planet from the Sun and has the fourth-largest planet by mass and third-largest by radius. It's also referred to as ice giant and its primary component is similar to Jupiter and Saturn but it also has more ices such as methane, water, and ammonia and also traces of hydrocarbons. It rotates in the opposite direction from all the planets except venus( it rotates from west to east).  
Neptune
It’s the eighth planet from the Sun. It’s the fourth-largest planet by diameter. The third most massive planet and is the densest giant planet - it’s slightly larger than Uranus and Neptune. It orbits the Sun every 164.8 years and is denser than Uranus and physically smaller than Uranus.
 
By the recent developments in more powerful telescopes and assisted by space exploration we have come to know about the presence of similar kinds of planets in other systems and constellations. With the unending effort of our Scientists and Astronomers, we may be surprised by the revelation of many mysteries that our Universe holds.
